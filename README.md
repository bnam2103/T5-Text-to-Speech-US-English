# TTS Audio Samples Comparison

This repository contains [audio samples](https://bnam2103.github.io/tts_t5/) generated by two different text-to-speech (TTS) models and the training notebook of these two models. The purpose of this project is to provide a side-by-side comparison of their output quality using various test sentences.

## Live Demo
You can try the models live through the following Hugging Face Spaces: [T5_First_US_Accent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nambn0321/T5_First_US_Accent) and [T5_Second_US_Accent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nambn0321/T5_Second_US_Accent)

## Models Used

- **Model A**: [`T5_US_Accent_1`](https://huggingface.co/nambn0321/T5_US_Accent_1)
  - Trained on: LJ Speech Dataset
  - Description: This model has been fine-tuned to produce a more natural and expressive speech synthesis with a typical American accent.
- **Model B**: [`T5_US_Accent_2`](https://huggingface.co/nambn0321/T5_US_accent_2)
  - Trained on: LibriVox Dataset
  - Description: The second model has a more neutral tone, with a vibe reminiscent of the AI assistant "Friday" from the Iron Man series.

## Notes

- Test Sentences: The test sentences used for evaluation were not included in the training set for either model. This ensures that the models are being evaluated on unseen data.

- Audio Playback: All samples are playable directly in the browser using <audio> elements, making it easy to listen to the comparisons without needing to download files.

- Model Optimization: Both models are currently being optimized to improve speech quality, particularly in terms of naturalness, prosody, and accent handling.

- Accents: Model A features a more natural humanlike American accent, while Model B adopts a neutral, balanced tone.

## Usage
```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the TTS model (Model A)
tts_model_a = pipeline("text-to-speech", model="nambn0321/T5_US_Accent_1")

# Generate speech from text
text_input = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
audio_output = tts_model_a(text_input)

# Save or play the output audio file
with open("output_model_a.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio_output["audio"])
```
